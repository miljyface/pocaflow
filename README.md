# Minimal-dependency Linear Algebra (pocaflow)

This is my personal playground for learning and building high-performance, low-level linear algebra in **Rust**, designed for speed, low dependencies, and compatibility with Python, running natively on Apple ARM64 (M1/M2/M3/MacBook Air, etc) **and now CUDA**.

This project is abandoned until further notice
